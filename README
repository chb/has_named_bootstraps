HasNamedBootstraps
==================

**This is alpha code.  The API is subject (and almost certain) to change.  It shouldn't hurt your computer or data, but if it does, I am not obligated to do anything, even feel sorry for you.**

has_named_bootstraps is a simple way to load bootstrapped records into class-level constants, and generate a list in another constant of all such bootstraps.  This is handy for generating <select>s and writing certain kinds of tests.

Getting the bootstrapped data in beforehand is up to you.  I like [seed_fu](http://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu) for this.

Example
=======

    class Department < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_named_bootstraps(
        :VALID_DEPARTMENTS,    # name of the constant that'll hold the list of all bootstrap constants
        :R_AND_D         => 'R&D',
        :MARKETING       => 'Marketing', 
        :HANDSOME_DEVILS => 'Web Development' 
      )
    end

    >> Department.find(:all)
    => [#<Department id: 1, name: "R&D">, #<Department id: 2, name: "Marketing">, #<Department id: 3, name: "Web Development">]
    >> Department::R_AND_D
    => #<Department id: 1, name: "R&D">
    >> Department::MARKETING
    => #<Department id: 2, name: "Marketing">
    >> Department::HANDSOME_DEVILS
    => #<Department id: 3, name: "Web Development">
    >> Department::VALID_DEPARTMENTS
    => [#<Department id: 1, name: "R&D">, #<Department id: 2, name: "Marketing">, #<Department id: 3, name: "Web Development">]

TODO
====

--make master constant list optional
--allow caller to specify an attribute to use to find record (currently hardcoded to "name")
